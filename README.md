This repository showcases a common error in Rust related to the unsafe use of raw pointers with vectors.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that directly manipulates a vector's memory using `as_mut_ptr()`, leading to potential undefined behavior.  The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates a safer alternative, employing Rust's ownership and borrowing system to prevent data corruption.  This example emphasizes the importance of safe memory management practices in Rust.
